# jdevTree Documentation Area

G'day everybody!

This repository holds all technical documents for my personal project jdevTree.

This is a project place where I can put to practise what I have learned and am still learning about in my profession.

I am by no means an expert on any topic, but feel free to reference any technology or concepts available here.

## Roadmap [TBC]

I have created certain roadmap, flow diagrams and system designs that have not been finalized. 

Mostly scribbles on papers as of now, upcoming documentation will be about POC of certain services and flows.

As you can view the full architecture diagram, there are a lot to be explored. So stay tuned!
